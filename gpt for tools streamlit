I have two CSV files:

1. Tool Configuration CSV
This file contains the list of available tools along with their corresponding API endpoints and the required parameters for each tool.


2. Customer Access CSV
This file contains unique customer IDs and maps each customer to the set of tools they are authorized to access. A customer may have access to one or multiple tools.



Functional Requirements

Tool access must be strictly enforced based on the customer access CSV.
A customer must not be allowed to invoke any tool that is not explicitly assigned to their customer ID.

For every valid request:

Construct the API request dynamically using:

The API endpoint URL

Required parameters defined in the tool configuration CSV

Payload values extracted from the LLM conversation (via Streamlit prompt input)


The request must be sent in the correct API URL / payload format as defined in the CSV.



Constraints

Do not assume, invent, or create new tools or API endpoints.

Do not hardcode:

Tool names

API endpoints

Parameters

Customer IDs

Access rules



All configurations must be driven entirely by the CSV files.

Dynamic Behavior

The system must support dynamic updates:

Any change to customer IDs or tool access in the customer access CSV

Any change to tool definitions or parameters in the tool configuration CSV
should be reflected immediately in the application behavior without requiring code changes or redeployment.



Authentication and Response Control

Customer ID authentication and authorization must occur before:

Tool selection

API request construction

Sending any response during the conversation


The application should return a response only after:

The customer ID is validated

Tool access is verified

The requested tool is confirmed to be authorized for that customer
