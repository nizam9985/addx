The definitions and distinctions between infrastructure layer, application layer, and domain layer generally align as follows:
	•	Infrastructure Layer: Provides technical services like database access, network, file system, external service communication, caching, authentication, and other system-level utilities.
	•	Application Layer: Handles application-specific use cases, workflows, business process flow orchestration, user request processing, coordination between domain operations, and may interface with external services but does not contain core business rules.
	•	Domain Layer: Contains the core business logic, rules, and entities. This layer encapsulates the domain knowledge and processing algorithms that define the business behavior.
Using these definitions, I will classify your list of functions/endpoints into a table by their likely layer, based on their name and presumed responsibility.
